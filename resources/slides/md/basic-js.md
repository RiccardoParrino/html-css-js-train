# General Structure: Primitive Types and Object types
In JavaScript there are two types of values:
- Primitive Types: String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, Symbol, Undefined, Null

- Object type: list of properties (key-value pair), it's mutable and it is created by literals, classes and functions: Object, Array, Function, Map, Date, RegExp, Set, Custom Class Instance

- primitive types are passed by value, object type are passed by reference
---
# General Structure: Numbers
- Integer Literals
- Floating-Point Literals
- Arithmetic in JavaScript
- Binary Floating-Point and Rounding Errors
---
# General Structure: Dates and Times
---
# General Structure: Text
- String Literals
- Escape Sequences in String Literals
- Pattern Matching
---
# General Structure: Boolean Values
---
# General Structure: null and undefined
---
# General Structure: The Global Object
---
# General Structure: Wrapper Objects
---
# General Structure: Immutable Primitive Values and Mutable Object Refereces
---
# General Structure: Type Conversions
- Conversions and Equality
- Explicit Conversions
- Object to Primitive Conversions
---
# General Structure: Variable Declaration
- Repeated and Omitted Declarations
---
# General Structure: Variable Scope
- global variables has global scope
- variabled declared within a function are defined only within the body of the function
- Function parameters also are local variables
- Local variable hides global variables with the same name
---
# General Structure: Var, Let and Const
- var: Declares variables with function or global scope and allow re-declaration and updates within the same scope (to be avoided)
- let: Declares variable with block scope, allowing updated but not re-declaration within the same block
- const: Declares block-scoped variables that cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment
---
# General Structure: Literals
- A literal is a data value that appears directly in a program
```
// These are all literals
var a = 12;
var s = "hello world";
var o = {x:1, y:2};
var ar = [1,2,3,4]
```
---
# General Structure: Variable Declaration
- var variable declaration
- 
---

# Regular Expression in JavaScript

---
# Regular Expression: Base syntax
```
const regex = /pattern/flags;
const regex = new RegExp("pattern", "flags");
```
---
# Regular Expression: Flag
- "g": global flag: find all matches in text
- "i": ignore case: find all matches ignoring the case
- "m": Multiline: find all matches for every line and the character $ and ^ are applied to every line, not at beginning or the end of the text
---

# Regular Expression: Basic Methods
- test(): return true or false if there is a match or not
- match(): retun the match found in the string
- replace(): find and substitute the matching text
- split(): return an array obtained splitting the text by matches
---
# Regular Expression: Common Special Characters
- ".": any chars
- "^": start of the string
- "$": end of the string
- "*": zero or more time
- "+": one time or more
- "?": zero or one time
- "{n}": exactly n times characters
---
# Regular Expression: Common Special Characters (2)
- \d: any digit
- [abc]: one of the characters
- [^abc]: none of the 
- \d: any digit
- \w: any word
- \s: space, tab or newline
- \: escape character
---
# Regular Expression: Generic Example
```
const email = "test@email.com";
const regex = /^[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+\.\w+$/;
console.log(regex.test(email)); // true
```

---
# Array in JavaScript
1. forEach, Map, Filter
2. Destructuring Array
3. Rest Operator

---
# Array: Adding and Deleting Array Elements
- to add an element use the push function:
```
a = [];             // Start with an empty array
a.push("zero");     // add a value at the end. a = ["zero"]
```
- to delete an element use the delete keyword
```
a = [1,2,3];
delete a[1];    // a now has no element at index 1
1 in a          // => false: no array index 1 is defined
a.length        // => 3: delete does not affect array length<>
```
---
# Array: Adding and Deleting Array Elements (2)
- You can also remove an element by reducing the length property
- pop() (push()) method return the element deleted
- shift() (unshift()) remove an element from the beginning of an array
---
# Multidimensional Array
```
// One example
var table = new Array(10);
table[0] = new Array(10);
// In this case, the table is not necessary a matrix, every row can have different length

// Initialize the array
for (var row = 0; row < table.length; row++) {
    for (col = 0; col < table[row].length; col++) {
        table[row][col] = row*col;
    }
}
```
---
# Array: Useful methods
- join()
- reverse()
- sort()
- concat()
- slice()
- splice()
- push() and pop()
- unshift() and shift()
- toString() and toLocaleString()
---
# ECMAScript 5 Array Methods
- forEach()
- map()
- filter()
- every() and some(): true if every element satisfy the condition, true if some of these
- reduce(), reduceRight(), start from the beginning or start from the last element
- indexOf() and lastIndexOf()
---
# Array: Destructuring Array

```
const numbers = [10,20,30];

// Destructuring
const [a,b,c] = numbers;

console.log(a); // 10
console.log(b); // 20
console.log(c); // 30
```

---

# Array: Destructuring Array (2)
```
const numbers = [10,20,30];

// Destructuring
const [first, , third] = numbers;

console.log(first); // 10
console.log(third); // 30
```

---

# Array: Destructuring Array (3)

```
const number = [5];
const [x,y = 99] = number;

console.log(x); // 5
console.log(y); // 99
```
---
# Array: Rest Operator and Spread Operator
Rest operator is used to collect data into arrays: Values -> Array
```
function sumRest (...numbers) {
    console.log(numbers);
}
sumRest(1,2,3);
```
Spread operator is used to spred data from array: Array -> Values
```
function sumSpread (numbers) {
    console.log(...numbers);
}
sumSpread([1, 2, 3]);
```
---

# General Structure: Var, Let or Const?
- var: legacy solution
- let: 
- const:
---

# Object in JavaScript
1. Basic feature of an object
2. Creating an Object
3. Destructuring an Object

---

# Object in JavaScript: Spread Operator and Rest Operator

```
const user = {
    name:"john",
    surname:"doe", 
    age:30,
};
const user_acces { access_time: [], access_ops: []; }
// copy (deep) w/ spread op
const copy_user = {...user};
// merge w/ spread op
const user_data = {user, user_data};
// overwrite props
const updated_user = {...user, age:31};

// Destructuring with rest op
const {nome, ...data} = user;
```
---
# Object in JavaScript: Constructor vs Function
Function and Constructor are very similar in JavaScript, take a look at this example

```
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.sayHello = function() {
        console.log("Hi, I'm " + this.name);
    };
}
const p1 = new Person("Anna");
p1.sayHello();
```
Main differences from a fuction: Capitalized name, this keyword, called with new

# Object Section
---

# Object Section: Pseudoclassical Pattern

---

# Object Section: Functional Pattern

---

# Object Section: Durable Object
- A durable object is an object that is created with functional style and  all of the methods of the object make no use of this or super class.

- A durable object is simply a collectino of functions that act as capabilities

---
# Object Section: How to Create an Object
- Create it as a Object Literal
- Call a pseudoclassical constructor with the `new` operator
- Call Object.create method on a prototype object
- Call a functional constructor
---

# Object section: How to make private properties and method in Object?
- Use the pseudoclassical pattern

---

# Object section: Parts pattern
- We can compose objects out of sets od parts

```
function canTalk(obj) {
  return {
    talk() {
      console.log(`talk`);
      }};}
function canWalk(obj) {
  return {
    walk() {
      console.log(`walk`);}};}
function canFly(obj) {
  return {
    fly() {
      console.log(`fly`);}};}
```
---
```
function createRobot(name) {
  const base = { name };
  return {
    ...base,
    ...canTalk(base),
    ...canWalk(base)
  };
}

function createDrone(name) {
  const base = { name };
  return {
    ...base,
    ...canFly(base),
    ...canTalk(base)
  };
}
```
---

# Object: Differential Inheritance
When you define a first initial object and then create another object with the same structure by expressing the differences with the first one

```
var myMammal =  {
    name: 'Herb the Mammal',
    get_name: function () {
        return this.name;
    }
    says: function () {
        return this.saying || '';
    }
}
var myCat = Object.create(myMammal);
myCat.name = 'Henrietta';
myCat.saying = 'meow';
myCat.purr = fuction (n) {/*express the purr function*/}
myCat.get_name = function() {/*overwrite the existing function*/}
```
---

# Class and OOP in JavaScript
1) Class
2) Prototype
3) Constructors
4) Types
5) Subclasses
6) Modules
7) Augmenting Classes

---

# Class and OOP: Class
- Class is not an object, it is a template for object
-  Constructors work as in Java
---
Abstract Example of JavaScript Class
```
class ClassName {
    constructor() {...}
    method_1() {...}
    method_2() {...}
    method_3() {...}
}
```
---
Concrete Example of JavScript Class

```
class Car {
    constructor(name, year) {
        this.name = name;
        this.year = year;
    }

    age(x) {
        return x - this.year;
    }
}

const myCar = new Car("Ford", 2014);
```
---

Classes are always executed in "strict mode", never in script mode.

---

# Class and OOP: Inheritance
- Inheritance is based on prototype chain (prototype-based inheritance)
- Every object has its own prototype
- To find the method to be executed on a certain object, explore the prototype chain to the null element
- Class is sintactic sugar for prototype. Behind a class definition there is always a prototype
---

# Class and OOP: Prototype
- actual version of the class definition
- Every object is linked to a prototype object from which it can inherit properties
- All object literals are linked to Object.prototype
- When you make a new object, you can select the object that should be its prototype
- Prototypes create the prototype chain, on which is applied the delegation process
---
# Class and OOP: Reflection and Enumeration
- The `for in` statement can loop over all of the property names in an object
- The `for in` loop will include all of the properties and funcitons of the object and of the prototypes
- to filter out some property and/or function use the hasOwnProperty Method and typeof (=== 'function')
```
const person = {
    name: "Tom",
    age: 30
}
console.log(person.hasOwnProperty("name)); // true
```
---
# Class and OOP: Delete
```
delete another_stooge.nickname;
```
This will remove the nickname only for the object on which is invoked, not on to the prototype

---

# Class and OOP: Global Abatement 
Don't use global variables, instead put it into a map

```
var MYAPP = {};
MYAPP.stooge {
    "first-name": "Jow",
    "last-name": "Howard"
};

MYAPP.flight = {
    airline: "Oceanic",
    number: 815,
    departure: {
        IATA: "SYD",
        time: "2004-09-22 14:55",
        city: "Sydney"
    },
    arrival {
        IATA: "LAX",
        time: "2004-09-23 10:42",
        city: "Los Angeles"
    }
};
```
---
# Class and OOP: Subclass Usage
- Inside the constructor you can call super()
- You can use extends keyword to extend one class
- You can use this keyword to referencing the attribute and the method of the class
---
# Class and OOP: Augmenting Classes
- An object inherits properties from its prototype, even if the prototype changes after the object is created
- Augment JavaScript classes simply by adding new methods to their prototype objects
- The prototype object of built-in JavaScript classes is "open", which means that we can add methods to numbers, strings, arrays, functions, and so on
---
# Class and OOP: Classes and Types
- typeof: operator that allow to distinguish among built-in types (null, undefined, boolean, number, string, function and object)
- classof(): access to the class attribute of Object
- class attribute of an object is not modifiable and for your own custom class is always `'Object'`, so
- classof() doesn't work for own-defined class, in these case use one of the following methods: instanceof, constructor property, constructor function name, duck-typing philosophy
---
# Class and OOP: Classes and Types (instanceof op)
- the expression o instanceof c evaluates to true if o inherits from c.prototype
- it doesn't work with primitive type
- One shortcoming is: by instanceof we can test if an object is instance of a certain class, but we cannot derive the class of the object by itself
---
# Class and OOP: Classes and Types (Constructor)
- Another way to identify the class of an object is to simply use the constructor property, that is the public face of the class

- One shortcoming is: JavaScript does not require that every object have a constructor property, sometimes it is accidentally omit, sometimes intentionally

- Sometimes can be useful get the name of the construct instead of the type but not all object have a constructor name defined and not all object have a constructor function with a nam
---
# Class and OOP: Classes and Type (Duck-Typing)
- not ask "what is the class of this object?", instead try asking "what can this object do?" 

- The general idea is: look if a certain object have a certain method or a certain property, without knowing if it is of a certain type

- this is the same concept of implementing an interface (e.g. implementing a functionality) instead of extending a class

---
# Class and OOP: Object-Oriented Techniques in JavaScript
- Encapsulation: private attribute with `#`
- Inheritance: with the extends keyword
- Polimorphism: overloading method
- Abstract: throwing exception
---
# Class and OOP: Object-Oriented Techniques (Polymorphism)
```
class Animal {
    name = undefined;
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    makeSound() {
        console.log("Need to be implemented!");
    }
}

class Tiger {
    constructor(name) {
        super(name);
    }
    makeSound() {
        console.log("Roar!");
    }
}
```
---
# Class and OOP: Object-Oriented Techniques (Abstract class and )
```
class Animal {
    constructor() {
        if (new.target === Animal) {
            throw new Error("Animal class is abstract!");
        }
    }

    makeSound() {
        throw new Error("Method to be implemented!");
    }
}

class Tiger {
    constructor() {
    }

    makeSound() {
        console.log("Roar!");
    }
}
```
---
# Class and OOP: Object-Oriented Techniques (Encapsulation)

```
class Person {
    #name = undefined;
    _surname = undefined;

    constructor (name, surname) {
        this.#name = name;
        this._surname = surname;
    }
}
```
The _underscore notation makes the attribute private by convention, but publicly accessible. The #hashtag notation makes the attribute purely private as other OOP language. 
---
# Class and OOP: Object-Oriented Techniques (get/set)
- Getter e setter in JavaScript
```
class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this._name = name;
    }

    get name() {
        return this._name.toUpperCase();
    }

    set name(val) {
        this._name = val;
    }
}
console.log(p.name); // actually, it calls the method
console.log(p.name());
p.name = "Luke"; // actually, it calls the method
p.name("Luke");

```
---
# Class and OOP: Object-Oriented Techniques (static)
- Example of static method
```
class MathUtils {
    static somma (a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
console.log(MathUtils.somma(2, 3)); // 5
```
---

# Class and OOP: Object Specifiers

Better way of writing constructors: 
```
// One way
var myObject = maker(f,l,m,c,s);
// Better way
var myObject = maker({
    first: f,
    last: l,
    state: s,
    city: c
})
```

# Function
---
# Function
1. Function Properties, Method and Constructor
1. Recursion
2. Scope
3. Closure
4. Callbacks
5. IIFE
5. Functional Programming
---

# Function: Hoisting
- Hoisting is the mechanism by which you can referred to the function before its declaration

---
# Function: Function Properties, Method and Constructor
- We say that in JavaScript Function are value, and so they have Constructor, Properties and Method

- Constructor: (not popular)

```
function myFunc(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

const myFunc = new Function('a','b','return a + b');
```

---
# Function: Function Properties, Method and Constructor (2)

- Properties: 
    - .length: number of parameters
    - .name: name of the function (void if anonymous)
    - .arguments: array of the arguments of the function
- Custom properties: you can add properties to a function
```
function greet() {}
greet.customProp = "Hello!";
console.log(greet.customProp); // "Hello!"
```
---
# Function: Function Properties, Method and Constructor (3)

- Method of the function:
    - call: call a function on an object
    - apply: as call, but arguments in the array
    - bind: a function to an object
    - toString: return the body of the function
---
# Function: Function Properties, Method and Constructor (Call and Apply)
```
f.call(o, 1, 2);
f.apply(o, [1,2]);

// does the same thing to:
o.m = f;
o.m([1,2]); // o.m(1,2) in the case of call
delete o.m;
```
---
# Function: Function Properties, Method and Constructor (Bind)
- The bind method bind a function f to an object o
- When you invoke bind on function, it will return a new function f, method of o
- Any arguments you pass to the new function are passed to the original function, but performing partial application
---
```
function sayHi(name) {
    console.log(`Hi, ${name}`);
}

sayHi.call(null,"Jack"); // "Hi, Jack"
sayHi.apply(null,["John"]); // "Hi, John"

const bound = sayHi.bind(null, "Tom");
bound() // "Hi, Tom"
```
---
# Function: Function Properties, Method and Constructor (4)
- The arrow function are lightweight function:
    - they don't have `this`, `arguments`, `super` nor `new.target`
    - they cannot be use as `constructor`
    - the don't have `prototype`
---
# Function: Function Properties, Method and Constructor (5)
- new.target is an attribute that is `true` if the function has been called with the `new` keyword, false otherwise

- this attribute can be used to ensure a function is called with the `new` keyword, as a constructor. This is the right way of realize a constructor by function

- this works also with class constructor

```
function MyObject() {
    if (!new.target) {
        throw new Error ("This function cannot be called without `new`!");
    }
    return myObject();
}
new MyObject(); // the correct way
MyObject(); // the wrong way
```
---

# Function: Augmenting Types
- JavaScripts allows the basic tyes of the language to be augmented

- Adding a method to Object.prototype makes that method available to all objects

- This also works for functions, arrays, strings, numbers, regular expressions and booleans
---
# Function: Exception
General Structure of the exception
```
try {
  // codice che può causare errori
} catch (err) {
  // gestisci l'errore
} finally {
  // (opzionale) codice che viene eseguito sempre
}
```
---
# Function: Type of Exception
- SyntaxError
- ReferenceError
- TypeError
- RangeError
- ...
- Custom Error
---
# Function: Custom Error
Create a custom error:
```
class MyCustomError extends Error {
  constructor(message) {
    super(message);
    this.name = "MyCustomError";
  }
}
throw new MyCustomError("My Custom Error!");
```
---
# Function: Exception in Asynchronous Programming
- use reject inside Promise
- you can pass an Error object inside the reject
```
const p = new Promise ( (resolve, reject) => {
reject(new Error('promise failed!'));
});
p.catch(
    err => {
        console.log(err);
    }
);
```
- use throw if you wanna create custom error
- you can use throw in a Promise
- you can use throw without Promise
---
# Function: Exception in Reject or Throw (2)
- throw insisde a callback function will not be recognized by a catch block, and in this case use reject
- if throw is encountered, the flow is immediately interrupted, meanwhile the reject end the block and then goes on error
- you cannot create custom error with reject
- if you create a reject error, should always be a catch block of the element

# Regular Expression in JavaScript

---

# Array in JavaScript
1. forEach, Map, Filter
2. Destructuring Array
3. Rest Operator

---

# Array: Destructuring Array

```
const numbers = [10,20,30];

// Destructuring
const [a,b,c] = numbers;

console.log(a); // 10
console.log(b); // 20
console.log(c); // 30
```

---

# Array: Destructuring Array (2)
```
const numbers = [10,20,30];

// Destructuring
const [first, , third] = numbers;

console.log(first); // 10
console.log(third); // 30
```

---

# Array: Destructuring Array (3)

```
const number = [5];
const [x,y = 99] = number;

console.log(x); // 5
console.log(y); // 99
```
---

# Array: Rest Operator

```
const [first, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40];

console.log(first); // 10
console.log(rest); // [20,30,40]
```

---

# Object in JavaScript
1. Basic feature of an object
2. Creating an Object
3. Destructuring an Object

---

# Class and OOP in JavaScript
1) Class
2) Prototype
3) Constructors
4) Types
5) Subclasses
6) Modules
7) Augmenting Classes

---

# Class and OOP: Class
- Class is not an object, it is a template for object
-  Constructors work as in Java
---
Abstract Example of JavaScript Class
```
class ClassName {
    constructor() {...}
    method_1() {...}
    method_2() {...}
    method_3() {...}
}
```
---
Concrete Example of JavScript Class

```
class Car {
    constructor(name, year) {
        this.name = name;
        this.year = year;
    }

    age(x) {
        return x - this.year;
    }
}

const myCar = new Car("Ford", 2014);
```
---

Classes are always executed in "strict mode", never in script mode.

---

# Class and OOP: Inheritance
- Inheritance is based on prototype chain (prototype-based inheritance)
- Every object has its own prototype
- To find the method to be executed on a certain object, explore the prototype chain to the null element
- Class is sintactic sugar for prototype. Behind a class definition there is always a prototype
---

# Class and OOP: Prototype
- actual version of the class definition
- 

---

# Class and OOP: Subclass Usage
- Inside the constructor you can call super()
- You can use extends keyword to extend one class
- You can use this keyword to referencing the attribute and the method of the class
---
# Class and OOP: Augmenting Classes
- An object inherits properties from its prototype, even if the prototype changes after the object is created
- Augment JavaScript classes simply by adding new methods to their prototype objects
- The prototype object of built-in JavaScript classes is "open", which means that we can add methods to numbers, strings, arrays, functions, and so on
---
# Function
1. Function Properties, Method and Constructor
1. Recursion
2. Scope
3. Closure
4. Callbacks
5. IIFE
5. Functional Programming

---

# Function: Function Properties, Method and Constructor
- We say that in JavaScript Function are value, and so they have Constructor, Properties and Method

- Constructor: (not popular)

```
function myFunc(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

const myFunc = new Function('a','b','return a + b');
```

---
# Function: Function Properties, Method and Constructor (2)

- Properties: 
    - .length: number of parameters
    - .name: name of the function (void if anonymous)
    - .arguments: array of the arguments of the function
- Custom properties: you can add properties to a function
```
function greet() {}
greet.customProp = "Hello!";
console.log(greet.customProp); // "Hello!"
```
---
# Function: Function Properties, Method and Constructor (3)

- Method of the function:
    - call: call a function on an object
    - apply: as call, but arguments in the array
    - bind: a function to an object
    - toString: return the body of the function
---
# Function: Function Properties, Method and Constructor (Call and Apply)
```
f.call(o, 1, 2);
f.apply(o, [1,2]);

// does the same thing to:
o.m = f;
o.m([1,2]); // o.m(1,2) in the case of call
delete o.m;
```
---
# Function: Function Properties, Method and Constructor (Bind)
- The bind method bind a function f to an object o
- When you invoke bind on function, it will return a new function f, method of o
- Any arguments you pass to the new function are passed to the original function, but performing partial application
---
```
function sayHi(name) {
    console.log(`Hi, ${name}`);
}

sayHi.call(null,"Jack"); // "Hi, Jack"
sayHi.apply(null,["John"]); // "Hi, John"

const bound = sayHi.bind(null, "Tom");
bound() // "Hi, Tom"
```
---
# Function: Function Properties, Method and Constructor (4)
- The arrow function are lightweight function:
    - they don't have `this`, `arguments`, `super` nor `new.target`
    - they cannot be use as `constructor`
    - the don't have `prototype`
---
# Function: Function Properties, Method and Constructor (5)
- new.target is an attribute that is `true` if the function has been called with the `new` keyword, false otherwise

- this attribute can be used to ensure a function is called with the `new` keyword, as a constructor. This is the right way of realize a constructor by function

- this works also with class constructor

```
function MyObject() {
    if (!new.target) {
        throw new Error ("This function cannot be called without `new`!");
    }
    return myObject();
}
new MyObject(); // the correct way
MyObject(); // the wrong way
```
---

# Function: Augmenting Types
- JavaScripts allows the basic tyes of the language to be augmented

- Adding a method to Object.prototype makes that method available to all objects

- This also works for functions, arrays, strings, numbers, regular expressions and booleans
---
# Function: Exception
General Structure of the exception
```
try {
  // codice che puÃ² causare errori
} catch (err) {
  // gestisci l'errore
} finally {
  // (opzionale) codice che viene eseguito sempre
}
```
---
# Function: Type of Exception
- SyntaxError
- ReferenceError
- TypeError
- RangeError
- ...
- Custom Error
---
# Function: Custom Error
Create a custom error:
```
class MyCustomError extends Error {
  constructor(message) {
    super(message);
    this.name = "MyCustomError";
  }
}
throw new MyCustomError("My Custom Error!");
```
---
# Function: Exception in Asynchronous Programming
- use reject inside Promise
- you can pass an Error object inside the reject
```
const p = new Promise ( (resolve, reject) => {
reject(new Error('promise failed!'));
});
p.catch(
    err => {
        console.log(err);
    }
);
```
- use throw if you wanna create custom error
- you can use throw in a Promise
- you can use throw without Promise
---
# Function: Exception in Reject or Throw (2)
- throw insisde a callback function will not be recognized by a catch block, and in this case use reject
- if throw is encountered, the flow is immediately interrupted, meanwhile the reject end the block and then goes on error
- you cannot create custom error with reject
- if you create a reject error, should always be a catch block of the element

# Basics in TypeScript

---
# Topics
- Basics
- Objects
- Enums
- Arrays
- Functions
- Classes and Interfaces
- Generics
- Basic Types
- Type Operators
- Working with Types
- Debugging

---
# Basics
- Install with `npm i -g typescript`
- Run with `tsc file-name`
- tsconfig.json: -outDir, 
---
# Basics: JS vs TS
- larger than js
- static typing
- code completion
---
# Basics: Type safety
- Type safety: Using types to prevent programs from doing invalid things
- Statically Typed: I made a mistake when I compile the program
- Dynamically Typed: I made a mistake when I RUN the program
- TypeScript is Statically Typed differently from JavaScript that is Dynamically Typed
---
# Basics: Compiler and Compiling Process
- TypeScript Compiler (TSC)
- How compilation works: text (code) -> compiler -> abstract syntax tree (AST) -> bytecode -> feed it into runtime and get results
- but before: TS code -> TS AST -> Typechecker -> JS Source
- Typechecker: A special program that verifies that your code is typesafe 
- Important fact: when TSC compiles your code from TypeScript to JavaScript, it won't look at your types
---
# Basics: TypeChecker
- Type System: A set of rules that a typechecker uses to assign types to your program
- General Rule: Type Explicitly Declared and Type Automatically Inferred
- Typescript does both: It can infer from example and you can declare it
- Good Programming style: Write where necessary, infer if it's possible
---
# Basics: tsconfig.json
- Every TypeScript project should include a file called tsconfig.json in its root directory
- It's a configuration file where you can set different properties of the compiling process
- You can set: which file should be compiled, which directory compile them to, which version of JavaScript to emit
- you can configure the tsconfig file also by command line
---
# Basics: tslint.json
- tslint.json for configuration and management of the code formatting style
---
# Types
- string, boolean, number
- any
- undefined
- null
```
let n: number = 10;
```
---
#  Types: Basic Types
- A set of values and the things you can do with them
- Example: boolean, string, number
---
# Types: TypeScript's type hierarchy
- Every type extends `unknown`
- `any` extends `unknown`
- number, bigint, boolean, string, symbol, Object types extend `any`
- bounds of types: a variable upper bound (in type) is number. It cannot be a string or more than a number it's not assignable
---
# Types: Fundamentals
- any: 
    - avoid, if you can
    - use it when you and the typechecker are not be able to infer the type
    - you can do everything and it can be everything
    - working with any is like working in JavaScript, without TypeChecker
- unknown
---
# Types: Fundamentals (2)
- boolean: as always, for the moment
- number: as always, for the moment
    - use_separators: 1_000_000
- bigint: as always, defined by n
- string
---
# Types: Fundamentals (Object)
```
let a = {
    b: 'x'
}
console.log(a.b);
let b = {
    c: {
        d: 'f'
    }
}
let a: {b: number} = {
    b: 12
}
let c: {
    firstName: string
    lastName: string
} = {firstName: 'john', lastName: 'barrowman' }
```
---
# Type: Classes
```
class Person {
    constructor (
        public firstName: string, // public is shorthand for
        public lastName: string // this.firstName = firstName
    ) {}
}
c = new Person('matt', 'smith');
```
---
# Types: Type Aliases
- Use it for DRYing up repeated complex types
```
type Age = number
type Person = {
    name: string
    age: Age
}
// you can also add function to a type aliases. In this case you are stating 
// the name of the function, 
// the input expected by the function and 
// the type of the value returned by the function.
type Persona = {
    name: string;
    greet: (messaggio: string) => void;
}
```
---
# Types: Union and Intersection Types
```
type Cat = {name: string, purrs: boolean}
type Dog = {name: string, barks: boolean, wags: boolean}
type CatOrDogOrBoth = Cat | Dog
type CatAndDog = Cat & Dog

let b: CatAndDog {
    name: 'Domino',
    barks: true,
    purrs: true,
    wags: true
}
```
---
# Types: Fundamentals (3)
- symbol
    - alternative to string keys in object and in map
- Objects
- Arrays
- Tuples
- null, undefined, void and never
- Enums
---
# Types: Arrays
```
let a = [1,2,3] // number[]
var b = ['a','b'] // string[]
let c: string[] = ['a'] // string[]
let d = [1,'a'] // (string | number)[]
const e = [2,'b'] // (string | number)[]
let f = ['red']
f.push('blue')
f.push(true) // Error TS2345: Argument of type 'true' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'
let g = [] // any[]
g.push(1) // number[]
g.push('red') // (string | number)[]
let h: number[] = [] // number[]
h.push(1) // number[]
h.push('red') // Error TS2345: Argument of type '"red"' is not assignable to parameter of type  'number'
```
---
# Types: Tuples
```
let a: [number] = [1]
// A tuple of [first name, last name, birth year]
let b: [string, string, number] = ['malcom', 'gladwell', 1963]

b = ['queen', 'elizabeth', 'ii', 1926] // Error TS2322: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'

// With optional element
let trainFares: [number, number?][] = [
    [3.75],
    [9.25, 7.70],
    [10.50]
]
// Equivalently
let moreTrainFares: ([number] | [number, number])[] = [
    //...
]
```
---
# Types: readonly Tuples and Arrays
```
let as: readonly number[] = [1,2,3]
let bs: readonly number[] = as.concat(4)
as[4] = 5 // Error readonly
as.push(6) // Error readonly
```
---
# Types: null, undefined, void and never
- undefined: used in case of something hasn't been defined yet
- null means an absecnce of value
- void: used in function that not return a value
- never: used in function that never returns a value, e.g throws an exception or cycle undefinitely
---
# Types: Enums
```
enum Language {
    English, Spanish, Russian
}
enum Language {
    English = 0, Spanish = 1, Russian = 2
}
let myFirstLanguage = Language.Russian
let mySecondLanguage = Language['English']
// You can split the definition in two parts
enum Language {
    English = 0,
    Spanish = 1
}
enum Language {
    Russian = 2
}
```
---
# Types: Enums (2)
```
enum Language {
    English = 100,
    Spanish = 200 + 300,
    Russion // inferred 501
}
enum Color {
    Red = '#c10000',
    Blue = #007ac1',
    Pink = 0xc10050,
    White = 255
}
let d = Color[6] // doesn't give you an error
const enum Language {
    English,
    Spanish,
    Russian
}
let a = Language.English
let b = Language.Tagalog // error!!!
let d = Language[6] // error!!!
```
---
# Functions
- Return type
- Optional parameters
- Narrowing
- Optional call
- Optional operator
---
# Functions: Declaring and Invoking Functions
```
function add(a: number, b: number) {
    return a + b
}
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b
}
```
---
# Functions: Optional and Default Parameters
```
function log(message: string, userId?: string) {
    let time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString()
    console.log(time,message,userId  || 'Not signed in')
}
function log(message: string, userId = 'Not signed in') {
    let time = new Date().toISOString()
    console.log(time, message, userId)
}
```
---
# Functions: Variable number params
```
function sum(numbers: number[]): number {
    return numbers.reduce( (total, n) => total + n, 0 )
}
```
---
# Function: Variable number params (2)
- Arity in functions is defined by the number of parameters that are expected to be passed
- A function is called Variadic, if the number of parameter is not fixed
-  A function is called fixed-arity function, if the number of parameter is given and fixed
---
# Function: Variable number params (3)
- A safe way to realize a variadic function in TypeScript is that in which you use the rest operator, declaring the type of the array
```
function sumVariadicSafe(...numbers: number[]): number {
    return numbers.reduce((total, n) => total + n, 0)
}
```
---
# Function: call, apply and bind
```
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b
}
add(10,20)                  // evaluates to 30
add.apply(null, [10,20])    // by spreading, evaluates to 30
add.call(null, 10, 20)      // by not spreading, evaluates to 30
add.bind(null, 10, 20)()    // by not spreading and not directly invoking, evaluates to 30
```
---
# Function: Typing this
- The  value of the `this` keyword depends on the context where it is used and
- It is managed by JavaScript
- In general, we can have the following usages:
    - in classes: it referes to the class where it is contained
    - in object: it referes to the object where it is contained
    - with call, apply and bind: it referes to the object that is bounded
---
# Function: Type Narrowing
```
function print(val: string | number) {
    if (typeof val === "string") {
        console.log(val.toUpperCase());
    } else {
        console.log(val.toFixed(2));
    }
}
// another way of doing Type Narrowing
if (error instanceof Error) {
}
```
---
# Function: in operator narrowing
```
type Bird = { fly: () => void };
type Fish = { swim: () => void };

function move(animal: Bird | Fish) {
    if ("fly" in animal) {
        animal.fly();
    } else {
        animal.swim();
    }
}
```
---
# Function: typeof and instanceof
- typeof is more used about primitive types
    - typeof returns the type of the argument, as 'string'
- instanceof is created for class
    - instanceof can only verify if a given arg is of that type or not, returning a boolean
---
# Function: type predicate
```
function isFish(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish {
    return (pet as Fish).swim !== undefined;
}
```
---
# Function: Discriminated Union
---
# Function: Generator Functions
- Generators are a way to produce a stream of values
```
function* createFibonacciGenerator() { // the asterisk before function's name makes that function a generator. 
    let a = 0
    let b = 1
    while(true) {
        yield a;
        [a,b] = [b, a+b]
    }
}

let fibonacciGenerator = createFibonacciGenerator()
fibonacciGenerator.next()
fibonacciGenerator.next()
fibonacciGenerator.next()
fibonacciGenerator.next()
fibonacciGenerator.next()
fibonacciGenerator.next()
```
---
# Function: Iterators
- Iterator are a way to consume values
```
let numbersIterator = {
    *[Symbol.iterator]() {
        for (let n = 1; n <= 10; n++){
            yield n;
        }
    }
}
for (let a of numbersIterator) {
    console.log(a);
}
```
- spreading an iterator: `let allNumber = [...numbers]`
- resting an iterator: `let [one, two, ...rest] = numbers`

# Classes and Interfaces: General Structure
```
class Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;

    constructor (name: string, age: number) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    greet(): void {
        console.log(`Hi, my name is ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old`);
    }
}

const henry = new Person("Henry", 30);
henry.greet(); // Hi, my name is Henry and I'm 30 years old
```
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Access Modifier
- `public` (default): accessible from anywhere
- `protected`: accessible from class and subclasses
- `private`: accessible only from the class
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Inheritance
```
class Vehicle {
    switchOn(): void {
        console.log("Vehicle switched on!");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    drive(): void {
        console.log("Driving the car!");
    }
}

const tesla = new Car();
tesla.switchOn();
tesla.drive();
```
---
# Classes and Interfaces: readonly property
```
class Book {
    readonly title: string;

    constructor(title: string) {
        this.title = title;
    }
}

const book = new Book("1984");
book.title = "Animal Farm";
```
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Getters and Setters
```
class Product {
    private _price: number;

    constructor(price: number) {
        this._price = price;
    }

    get price(): number {
        return this._price;
    }

    set price(val: number) {
        if (val > 0)
            this._price = val;
    }
}
```
- a class can extend only one other class and implements multiple interface
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Getters and Setters (2)
- if `get` exists but no `set`, the property is automatically `readonly`
- if the type of the setter parameter is not specified, it is inferrend from the returned type of the getter
- getters and setters are accessors, it means they should use in this way:
---
```
class Person {
    _name: string;
    _age: string;

    constructor(name:string, age:string) {
        this._name = name;
        this._age = age;
    }

    get name():string {
        return this._name;
    }
    
    set name(name:string) {
        this._name = name;
    }
}
const myPerson = new Person("ric",30);
myPerson.name = "par";
```
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Static Properties and Methods
```
class Math {
    static PI = 3.14;

    static squared (x: number): number {
        return x * x;
    }
}
console.log(Math.PI);
console.log(Math.squared(5));
```
---
# Classes and Interfaces: General Information on Interfaces
- Using the keyword `implements` you can say that a particular class satisfies a particular interface
- The class implementing the interface must implement all of the methods declared in it
- Interfaces can state readonly properties, but it cannot declare access modifiers (they are public by default) 
-  A class can implements a number of interface
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Interfaces and Implementations
- An implementation as example
```
interface Animal {
    name: string;
    makeSound(): void;
}
class Dog implements Animal {
    name: string;

    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    makeSound(): void {console.log("Bau!");}}
```
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Abstract Class
- Another way of model a concept is by using Abstract Classes. These can have constructors, default implementations and set access modifiers for properties and methods.
```
abstract class Animal {
    constructor(public name: string) {}

    greet(): void {
        console.log("Hi, my name is ${this.name}");
    }

    abstract makeNoise(): void;
}
```
- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, the implemented methods are inherited as they are and abstract methods must be realized before instantiation
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Use Interfaces or Abstract Class?
- An interface give you a shape to be satisfied
- An abstract class give you a structure that all of the class implementing that should satisfied
- In general: use an interface to give functionalities, meanwhile use an abstract class to structure a class which behavior cannot be realized at the beginning
---
# Classes and Interfaces: TypeScript is Structurally Typed
- Differently from Java, C#, Scala and other languages that are Nominally Typed, TypeScript doesn't make difference between based on the name of the class but based on the functionalities it expose
- This feature is related to the Duck Typing Philosophy
- A small exception is related to private and protected fields of the class: if a class have same private or protected field and the shape is not an instance of that class or a subclass, the shape is not assignable to the class
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Details On Inheritance
- If the super class have some private field, the subclass inherits the private field, but it cannot access to it
---
# Classes and Interfaces: super call
- super call: if the child class overrides a method defined on its parent class, the child instance can make a super call to call its parent's version of the method
---
# Classes and Interfaces: this as return type
```
class Set {
    has(value: number): boolean {
        // ...
    }
    add(value: number): this {
        // ...
    }
}
```
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Type Aliases and Interfaces (1)
- Comparison between type aliases and interfaces
```
type Sushi = {
    calories: number
    salty: boolean
    tasty: boolean
}
interface Sushi = {
    calories: number
    salty: boolean
    tasty: boolean
}
```
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Type Aliases and Interfaces (2)
- Comparison between type aliases and interfaces
```
type Food = {
    calories: number
    tasty: boolean
}
type Sushi = Food & {
    salty: boolean
}
type Cake = Food & {
    sweet: boolean
}
```
```
interface Food {
    calories: number
    tasty: boolean
}
interface Sushi extends Food {
    salty: boolean
}
interface Cake extends Food {
    sweet: boolean
}
```
--- 
# Classes and Interfaces: Type Aliases and Interfaces (3)
- Differences between Type Aliases and Interfaces:
    - Inheritance: Interfaces can be extended
    - Interface merging: type can be extended only with `&` (intersection), and it cannot be redefined
    - Union and Intersection: only type aliases can create advanced type with union and intersection
    - Type is better to use with primitive types and tuples
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Constructor Overloading
```
class User {
    name: string;
    age?: number;

    constructor(name: string);
    constructor(name: string, age: number);
    constructor(name: string, age?: number) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```
- You cannot specify the behavior for every example, instead based on type, you specify the logic for every case inside the only one body of the costructor
---
# Classes and Interfaces: super or this?
- The inheritance mechanism is managed by javascript using the prototype chaining
- The property are setted in the actual object, meanwhile
- The methods and the accessors are referred by the prototype chaining, so they live in the super class and not in the actual class
- In summary:
    - use `this` to access to the props of the subclasses and all of the superclasses
    - use `super` to access to methods and accessors of the superclasses
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Declaration Merging
```
class A {
    do(): string {
        return `do`;
    }
}
class A {
    anotherDo(): string {
        return `another do`;
    }
}
```
- this code is correct in TypeScript and the resulting class A have two different method: "do" and "anotherDo"
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Declaration Merging (2)
- This holds also for interfaces
```
interface A {
    do(): string;
}
interface A {
    anotherDo(): string;
}
// the resulting interface have two differents methods: do and anotherDo
```
- This holds for Classes, Interfaces and Enums but not for Type Aliases
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Declaration Merging (3)
- There is some exception:
```
interface Person {
    phone_number: string
}
interface Person {
    phone_number: number // Error the type should be the same
}
```
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Declaration merging (4)
- Same happen for generic interfaces
```
interface Person<Phone extends number> {
    phone: Phone
}
interface Person<Phone extends string> {
    phone: Phone
}
```
- this will rise an error where all declaration must have the same type parameters
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Anonymous Inner Classes
- In TypeScript is possible to define an Anonymous Inner Class
```
function createSpecialObject() {
    return new class {
        greet() {
            console.log("Hi from anonymous inner class!");
        }
    }
}
const o = createSpecialObject();
o.greet();
```
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Anonymous Inner Classes (2)
- You can also use the Anonymous Inner Class to implement an Interface
```
interface Greetings {
    greet(): void;
}
function createImplementation(msg: string): Greetings {
    return new class implements Greetings {
        greet(): void {
            console.log(msg);
        }
    }
}
const myGreet = createImplementation("Hi from Richard!");
myGreet.greet();
```
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Mixin (Implementation)
```
type ClassConstructor = new(...args: any[]) => {}

function withEXDebug<C extends ClassConstructor>(Class: C) {
    return class extends Class {
        debug() {
            let Name = Class.constructor.name
            let value = this.getDebugValue()
            return Name + '(' + JSON.stringify(value) + ')'
        }
    }
}
```
- With Type Aliases and Anonymous Inner Classes in mind, we have realized a mixin in TypeScript
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Mixin
- Mixin are a way to share functionalities betwen class or interfaces without directly extends or inherits that
- Natively not supported by TypeScript, but they can be implemented building a function that get as input a class and returns a new anonymoud class that extends the one given as input and introducing new functionalities (as method or fields) in the first one
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Decorator
- Decorator is a new feature of TypeScript and it permits to add functionalities to a class with the use of annotations
```
type ClassConstructor<T> = new (...args: any[]) => T
function serializable<T extends ClassConstructor<{getValue(): Payload}>> {
    return class extends Constructor {
        serialize () {
            return this.getValue().toString();
        }
    }
}
@serializable
class APIPayload {
    getValue(): Payload {
        // ...
    }
}
```
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Decorator (2)
- Every time you want to use a Decorator, you should implement the function to make it works
- Decorator is a new feature of TypeScript and it is better to use mixin meanwhile it became more mature
---
# Classes and Interfaces: Simulating final Classes
- We can simulate the final class (e.g., non extensible class) in TypeScript by marking as private the constructor of the class
```
class MessageQueue {
    private constructor(private messages: string[]) {}
}
``` 
- By doing so, you avoid the access to the constructor for the subclass, but in this way you cannot instatiate that. To solve this problem add a static method like this:
```
class MessageQueue {
    private constructor(private messages: string[]) {}
    static create(messages: string[]) {
        return new MessageQueue(messages);}
}
``` 
---
# Advanced Types: Topic
- Relationships between Types
- Subtypes and Supertypes
- Variance
- Assignability
- Type Widening
- Refinement
---
# Advanced Types: Subtypes and Supertypes
- Supertypes: If you have tow type A and B, and B is a supertype of A, then you can safely use A anywhere a B is required
- Subtypes: If you have two types A and B, and B is a subtype of A, then you can safely use a B anywhere an A is required
---
# Advanced Types: Variance
- Starting with some general answer:
    - When is `Array<A>` a subtype of `Array<B>`?
    - When is a shape `A` a subtype of another shape `B`?
    - When is a function `(a: A) => B` a subtype of another function `(c: C) => D`?
---
# Advanced Types: Variance Design Landscape
- When a complex object (shape, function, array...) is a subtype of another?
    - Invariance: a complex object B is a subtype of another complex object A iff it is of the exact same parametric type
    - Covariance: a complex object B is a subtype of another complex object A iff it is of the exact same parametric type or a subtype of the type
    - Contravariance: a complex object B is a subtype of another complex object A iff it is of the exact same parametric type or a supertype of the type
    - Bivariance: a complex object B is a subtype of another complex object A, no matter the relationship of the parametric type
---
# Advanced Types: Shape and Array Variance
- In TypeScript: every complex type is covariant in its members
- Another example is Java, in which: every complex type is invariant in its members
---
# Advanced Types: Function variance
- A function A is a subtype of function B if A has the same or lowe arity than B and:
    1. A's this type either isn't specified, or is >: B's this type
    2. Each of A's parameters is >: its corresppnding parameter in B
    3. A's return type is <: B's return type
- An example:
```
function clone (f: (b: Bird) => Bird): void {
    let parent = new Bird();
    let babyBird = f(parent); // if this function f doesn't return a type or a subtype of B,
    babyBird.chirp() // you cannot call .chirp() on babyBird()
}
```
---
# Advanced Types: Assignability
- When TypeScript wants to answer the question "Is type A assignable to type B?"
For non-enum types, A is assignable to B if either of the following is true:
    1. if A <: B
    2. A is any
For enum types, an enum A is assignable to enum B if either of these is true:
    1. A is a member of enum B
    2. B has at least one member that's a `number`, and A is a `number`

# Advanced Types: Type Widening
- In TypeScript you can have a literal type, that represents a precise value, like this:
```
let a: "hi";
```
- And you have also the generic types, that represents a widening value, like this:
```
let name: string;
let n: number;
let b: boolean;
```
- The Type Widening widen your literal value to a generic types, this happen when you assign a value:
```
let state = "ok"
```
---
# Advanced Types: Type Widening (2)
- If you want that the type remain literal, you can use the keyword const
```
const state = "ok"
```
---
# Advanced Types: Excess property checking
- When you try to assign a fresh object literal type T to another type U, and T has properties that aren't present in U, TypeScript reports an error
---
# Advanced Types: Fresh Object Literal Type
- A fresh object literal type is the type TypeScript infers from an object literal, then the fresh object literal type is widened to a regular object type and its freshness disappears

# Generics
---
# Generics: Base Syntax
```
function id<T>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
}

let result = id<string>("ciao");
let result = id("ciao");
```
---
# Generics: Class and Interfaces
```
class Container<T> {
    private value: T;
    constructor(value: T) {
        this.value = value;
    }
    getValue(): T {
        return this.value;
    }
}
interface Pair<T, U> {
    key: T;
    value: U;
}
```
- Note that a static method do not have access to the generics type of the class
---
# Generics: Constrain on Generics
```
interface HasDistance {
    distance: number;
}
function logDistance<T extends HasDistance>(arg: T): void {
    console.log(arg.distance);
}
```
In this way, `logDistance` will accept only types that have a distance property.

- You can use primitive type in parametric type also

```
type Box<T> = {value: T};

# Asynchronous Programming in TS: JavaScript's Event Loop
- JavaScript manage concurrency using the event-loop model
- Javascript is single threaded
- This is the cycle:
    1. every time you call a function youpput it into the call stack, used as a queue
    2. libuv api if somehting asynchronous are loading
    3. as finish it goes to the event queue
    4. the event loop look inside the event queue and search for event to put into the callstack, and then remove it 
---
# Asynchronous Programming in TS: JavaScript's Event Loop (2)
- Summary: if it's not an asynchronous process, it will be put into the callstack, otherwise it will be put in the event queue or in the libuv stack, until they get complete and then passed into the callstack
